# Machine-learning-ngram


In this project, program for the SMS Spam Detection based on character n-gram models approach is explained. In order to
implement the program, python programming language is used. For training and testing the model the program used UCI Machine
Learning Repository SMS Spam Collection dataset. In order to use the dataset for n-gram model pre-processing is performed to
clean the dataset. The dataset is then divided into training and test sets by taking 80% of dataset as training dataset and remaining
as test dataset. The training procedure is performed by calculating the probability of all bigrams and trigrams in the training
dataset. The testing procedure then determines the probability of all SMS messages in the test dataset. The program is found to
produce good results for both bigram and trigram models.
